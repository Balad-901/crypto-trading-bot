Without any specific historical trade memory data provided, I'm unable to provide a detailed analysis. However, I can share some general patterns that often lead to profitable trades and those to avoid:

Profitable Patterns:
1. Bullish Patterns: These include patterns like ascending triangles, bull flags, and cup and handle. These patterns often indicate a potential upward price movement.
2. High Trading Volume: A sudden increase in trading volume can often precede a price change. High trading volume can indicate strong investor interest and can lead to more predictable price movements.
3. Moving Average Crossovers: This is a situation where the short-term moving average of a cryptocurrency crosses above its long-term moving average, often indicating a potential upward price movement.
4. Breakouts: When a cryptocurrency price moves outside a defined support or resistance level with increased volume, a breakout has occurred. This can often lead to profitable trades if the trader enters at the start of the breakout.

Patterns to Avoid:
1. Bearish Patterns: These include patterns like descending triangles, bear flags, and head and shoulders. These patterns often indicate a potential downward price movement.
2. Low Trading Volume: Low trading volume can indicate a lack of investor interest and can lead to more unpredictable price movements.
3. Overbought or Oversold Conditions: If a cryptocurrency is in an overbought or oversold condition as indicated by oscillators like RSI, it could be due for a price correction.
4. False Breakouts: These occur when a price breaks past a certain level, but does not continue to accelerate in that direction. This can lead to losses if a trader enters a position based on the initial breakout.

Remember, while these patterns can provide helpful guidance, they do not guarantee profitable trades. It's essential to use them in conjunction with other trading tools and strategies.
